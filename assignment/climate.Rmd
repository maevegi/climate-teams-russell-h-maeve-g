# Unit I: Climate Change Module

## Warm-up exercise: Examining CO2 trends in R

- Example from <http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/>
- Raw data from <https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt>

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r message=FALSE}

co2 <- 
read_table("https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt", 
                  comment="#",
                  col_names = c("year", "month", "decimal_date", "monthly_average",
                                "interpolated", "days", "std", "uncertainty"),
<<<<<<< HEAD
                  na = c("-1", "-99.99", "-0.99"))
=======
                  na = c("-1", "-9.99", "-0.99"),
           col_types = "iidddddd")
>>>>>>> 7137f79 (WIP Exercise 3 Q2 :cry:)
co2
```


```{r}
ggplot(co2, aes(x = decimal_date, y = monthly_average)) + geom_line() 

```

Which months are the CO2 values at the maximum? Minimum?  Why is this?

What rolling average is used in computing the "trend" line?  How does the trend depend on the rolling average?

# Exercise I: Temperature Data

Each of the last years has consecutively set new records on global climate.  In this section we will analyze global mean temperature data.

Data from: <http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature>

## Question 1:

Describe the data set to the best of your ability given the documentation provided.  Describe what kind of column each data contains and what units it is measured in.  Then address our three key questions in understanding this data:

- How are the measurements made? What is the associated measurement uncertainty?
The measurements are collected from NASA's Goddard Institute Institute for Space studies. The data includes the global average surface temperature from 1880 to 2022. The measurements are made as the hange in surface temrpature compared to the average from 1951 to 1980. The measurement uncertainty is Lowess smoothing, which averages the data.
- What is the resolution of the data?
The data is measured in annual mean temperature in Celsisus. 
- Are their missing values? How should they be handled?
The only obvious gap in data is temperature data pre-1880. 

## Question 2:

Construct the necessary R code to import and prepare for manipulation the following data set: <http://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/647_Global_Temperature_Data_File.txt>
```{r}
globaltemp<-
read_table("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/graph_data/Global_Mean_Estimates_based_on_Land_and_Ocean_Data/graph.txt",
           skip=5, 
           col_names= c("Year", "Annual_mean", "Lowess_smoothing"))
col_double = ("Year")
col_double = ("Annual_mean")
col_double = ("Lowess_smoothing")
globaltemp
```


## Question 3:

Plot the trend in global mean temperatures over time.  Describe what you see in the plot and how you interpret the patterns you observe.


## Question 4: Evaluating the evidence for a "Pause" in warming?

The [2013 IPCC Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SummaryVolume_FINAL.pdf) included a tentative observation of a "much smaller increasing trend" in global mean temperatures since 1998 than was observed previously.  This led to much discussion in the media about the existence of a "Pause" or "Hiatus" in global warming rates, as well as much research looking into where the extra heat could have gone.  (Examples discussing this question include articles in [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/04/global-warming-hasnt-paused-study-finds), [BBC News](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28870988), and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_hiatus)). 

By examining the data here, what evidence do you find or not find for such a pause?  Present an analysis of this data (using the tools & methods we have covered in Foundation course so far) to argue your case.  

What additional analyses or data sources would better help you refine your arguments?

## Question 5: Rolling averages
    
- What is the meaning of "5 year average" vs "annual average"?
- Construct 5 year averages from the annual data.  Construct 10 & 20-year averages. 
- Plot the different averages and describe what differences you see and why.  





# Exercise II: Melting Ice Sheets?

- Data description: <http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/>
- Raw data file: <http://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/499_GRN_ANT_mass_changes.csv>

## Question 1:

- Describe the data set: what are the columns and units? Where do the numbers come from? 
The data set represents the amount Antarctic and Greenland ice mass per year. The mass of the ice is measured in gigatons per year. The columns are year, Anarctic mass, and Greenland ice mass. The data comes from NASA's GRACE and GRACE follow-on satellites.
- What is the uncertainty in measurement? Resolution of the data? Interpretation of missing values?
The data points have a margin of uncertainty of about 27 to 60 Gt at each measurement point. There is missing data from the years 2017 to June of 2018 due to the cessation of the initial GRACE mission. 

## Question 2:

Construct the necessary R code to import this data set as a tidy `Table` object.
```{r}
ice<- read_csv("http://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/499_GRN_ANT_mass_changes.csv",
               skip=10,
               col_names=c("decimal_date", "Greenland_mass", "Antarctic_mass"),
               col_types="ddd")
ice
```


## Question 3:

Plot the data and describe the trends you observe.

```{r}
ggplot(ice, aes(x= decimal_date, y= Greenland_mass))+geom_line()
ggplot(ice, aes(x= decimal_date, y= Antarctic_mass))+ geom_line()
```
Both plots display small seasonal variations in ice mass as ice melts in the spring and reforms in the winter. However, both plots display an overall decline in ice mass. The Greenland ice mass appears to follow a fairly regular decline, while the Antarctic ice mass data has greater variation. Additionally, the rate of change for the Greenland ice is almost twice as fast as that of the Antarctic ice. 

# Exercise III: Rising Sea Levels?

- Data description: <http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/>
- Raw data file: <http://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/121_Global_Sea_Level_Data_File.txt>


## Question 1:

- Describe the data set: what are the columns and units? 
This table is measuring the Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) variation
3,  12

HDR
- Where do these data come from? 

- What is the uncertainty in measurment? Resolution of the data? Interpretation of missing values?


## Question 2:

Construct the necessary R code to import this data set as a tidy `Table` object.

```{r}

sea_level <-
#read_table ("http://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/121_Global_Sea_Level_Data_File.txt",
#            skip = 21,
#           comment = "HDR",
#            col_names = c("baba", "caca", "decimal_year", "yaya", "papa", "haha", "lala", "iaia", "uaua", "tata", "wawa", "sea_level_variation"),
#cols_only("decimal_year","sea_level_variation")
sea_level
```


## Question 3:

Plot the data and describe the trends you observe.

## Question 1:

- Describe the data set: what are the columns and units? 
- Where do these data come from? 
- What is the uncertainty in measurement? Resolution of the data? Interpretation of missing values?


## Question 2:

Construct the necessary R code to import this data set as a tidy `Table` object.

## Question 3:

# Exercise V: Longer term trends in CO2 Records


The data we analyzed in the unit introduction included CO2 records dating back only as far as the measurements at the Manua Loa observatory.  To put these values into geological perspective requires looking back much farther than humans have been monitoring atmosopheric CO2 levels.  To do this, we need another approach.
